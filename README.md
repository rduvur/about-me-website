# about-me-website

Welcome to my first website. This project provided me with a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I utilized the Three.js library to create an interactive animation on the splash screen, incorporating some 3D graphics and visual effects.

##link.html

uses the three.js ascii renderer to depict a 3D model of link that can be swiveled.

##home.html

html file. Contains main content of site including hobbies, interests, projects etc. Contains embedded, gifs, spotify playlists, and hyperlinks.

##style.css

Basic styling. Has code that implements a hover feature where content is expanded when the cursor is near. 

##app.js

Creates the live typing effect and scroll animation when user clicks the button on the splash page.
